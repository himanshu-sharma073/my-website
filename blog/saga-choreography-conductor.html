        <h1>Designing Saga Choreography for Workflow Engines</h1>
        <p class="article-summary">
          Netflix Conductor orchestrates 30+ critical workflows inside our
          Freshworks iPaaS. Here is how I pair saga choreography with Change
          Data Capture (CDC) to keep microservices consistent without slowing
          down developer velocity.

          <h2>Why Saga + CDC?</h2>
          <p>
            Traditional two-phase commit approaches buckle under the latency
            profile of omnichannel integrations. Saga choreography allows every
            service to manage its own compensation logic, while CDC guarantees
            that state changes are visible to Conductor in near real time.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Each service emits domain events to DynamoDB streams.</li>
            <li>CDC relays events into Kafka topics dedicated per domain.</li>
            <li>
              Conductor tasks subscribe to those topics to decide progression or
              rollback.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <section class="article-section">
          <h2>Workflow Contract</h2>
          <p>
            Every workflow definition includes an explicit
            <strong>task domain contract</strong> so we can route execution to
            language-specific workers (Java WebFlux vs. Node.js). Domains also
            control isolation boundaries for throttling and alerting.
          </p>
          <div class="article-note">
            Pro tip: expose the contract via metadata so UI and API consumers
            can search workflows by domain (now supported upstream via my PR
            #492).

          <h2>Choreography Guardrails</h2>
          <p>
            Choreography can devolve into spaghetti if not governed. I enforce a
            few non-negotiables:
          </p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <strong>Idempotent tasks</strong> with deterministic compensation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Time-boxed states</strong>: every task publishes heartbeat
              events so Conductor can trigger retries or compensations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Tracing parity</strong>: propagate OpenTelemetry baggage so
              CDC and workflow logs can be correlated with Grafana dashboards.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </section>

        <section class="article-section">
          <h2>Operational Outcomes</h2>
          <p>
            By combining CDC + saga we reduced reconciliation incidents by 60%,
            and onboarding a new workflow now takes hours rather than days.
            Developers work inside their preferred stack, while platform teams
            maintain real-time visibility through Conductor’s summary index.
